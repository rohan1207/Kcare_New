    overview: [
      "Piles are swollen veins around the anus or rectum that can cause bleeding, itching, or pain while passing stool. They’re very common and often linked to constipation, prolonged sitting, or straining during bowel movements.",
    ],
    whenToConsult: [
      "Bleeding during or after passing stool",
      "Pain, swelling, or itching in the anal region",
      "A lump or feeling of something ‘coming out’",
    ],
    treatmentOptions: [
      "Mild piles can often be managed with dietary changes, increased fibre, and medicines. For advanced cases, laser or stapler surgery offers a modern, painless solution.",
      "The laser piles procedure takes about 20–30 minutes under anaesthesia. It seals the swollen veins using focused laser energy without cuts or stitches.",
    ],
    recovery: [
      "Most patients go home the same day and resume normal activities within 2–3 days.",
      "Complete healing usually takes 1–2 weeks.",
    ],
    whyChooseUs: [
      "We use advanced laser and minimally invasive tools for a faster, safer, and more comfortable recovery.",
      "Minimal bleeding with almost no recurrence in most cases.",
